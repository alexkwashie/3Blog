            Fundamentals are very important, they are the building blocks of anything. No matter what you want to learn, you cannot just simply jump half way in between, but instead you must start at the very beginning to help understand how it came into being.The same ideology works with computer programming and web development as well. Understanding the basics of programming and development will help build a better understanding of the subject and will allow you to mold it to your particular needs and wants.
